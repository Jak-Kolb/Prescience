# training

Training orchestration (wrappers around Ultralytics training).

## Responsibilities
- Launch training runs with project defaults
- Save weights and metadata in a consistent location
- Record params/metrics for reproducibility

## Notes
Training workflows change often; keep them isolated from runtime pipelines.
